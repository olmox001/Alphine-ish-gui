Python GUI Module for Alpine iSH (iOS Linux Shell Emulator)

This Python module leverages Tkinter to create and manage a graphical user interface (GUI) within Alpine iSH, a Linux shell emulator for iOS. While running GUI applications in Alpine iSH can be challenging due to various system limitations, this module provides a functional solution for launching and interacting with Tkinter-based interfaces.

Features
	•	Uses Tkinter to render a GUI inside Alpine iSH.
	•	Provides a basic yet functional interface despite some system-related constraints.
	•	Demonstrates how to work with graphical elements in a non-standard Linux environment on iOS.
	•	Includes error handling for common compatibility issues.

Limitations & Known Issues
	•	Due to Alpine iSH’s restricted environment, some Tkinter functionalities may not work as expected.
	•	Graphical performance may be limited compared to running Tkinter on a standard Linux distribution.
	•	Further optimizations are needed to improve stability and usability.
